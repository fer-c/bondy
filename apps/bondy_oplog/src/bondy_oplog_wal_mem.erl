?MODULEDOC("""
In-memory (ETS) write-ahead log backend for **ephemeral fused** instances.

This is the throughput lever for the ephemeral 20k goal. The disk WAL
(`bondy_oplog_wal`) welds the drain's *visibility* of an event to the durable
position, which only advances at an fsync boundary; so even in `batched` mode
the fused drain consumes a batch only after a `datasync` completes. That
durability latency — not the install round-trip (H1, already removed) — is the
binding constraint at ~42% scheduler utilisation.

For an **ephemeral** instance that constraint is redundant: the projection and
MST are themselves ETS (lost on node death) and durability is already
cluster-provided via anti-entropy (`integrate_peer_root` is not gated on
durability). This module makes the WAL ephemeral too: events live in a
`protected ordered_set` keyed by a dense monotonic `Seq`, the fused drain reads
them via `bondy_oplog_wal_mem_reader` the instant they are inserted, and there
is **no fsync and no disk I/O on the ack path**. `head == durable` at all times.

### Shared protocol, one different surface

This gen_server speaks the **same `gen_server` message protocol** as
`bondy_oplog_wal` for the producer + control surfaces:

- `{append_batch, Events}` — assign a `Seq` range, insert, bump head.
- `{await_durable, {Seg, Off}, Timeout}` — block until `head_seq >= Off`.
- `durable_position` — `{?MEM_SEG, head_seq}` (head is always durable here).
- `{set_committed_segment, Seg}` — retention marker (no-op for now; GC is deferred).

So callers reach this module through the existing `bondy_oplog_wal:append_batch/2`,
`await_durable/3`, `durable_position/1` and `set_committed_segment/2` wrappers
(all of which are module-agnostic `gen_server:call/2,3` shims) with the mem-WAL
pid — **no producer-side dispatch is needed**. The single surface that genuinely
differs is the *reader*: the disk reader reads segment files via an fd, the mem
reader reads the ETS table. That is dispatched in the fused drain
(`bondy_oplog_instance`) on a `wal_backend` flag; `bondy_oplog_wal`,
`bondy_oplog_wal_reader` and `bondy_oplog_applier` stay untouched.

### Durability decision (cluster-durable)

Dropping the fsync widens the acked-but-not-yet-replicated loss window to also
include a BEAM crash with surviving disk (the disk WAL would replay it). This is
accepted by design for ephemeral instances and covered by anti-entropy in normal
operation.

### Deferred

- Crash recovery: an `heir`-owned table survives a writer process crash. Today
  the table dies with this gen_server (node/process death → re-sync from peers).
- Retention/GC: delete entries below the committed `Seq` via `ets:select_delete`.
  Until then the log grows for the run; the byte cap (`max_total_wal_size`) bounds
  it via `{error, wal_full}` backpressure, sufficient for bounded benches.
