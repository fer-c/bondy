?MODULEDOC("""
A single anti-entropy sync session.

Implements the **pull-direction** of the MST reconciliation protocol
(`_design/10_new_design.md` §7): the *initiator* (this side) repeatedly
asks the *peer* for pages it is missing until its local copy of the
peer's tree is complete. Two such sessions — A pulling from B *and* B
pulling from A — converge both replicas to the same root.

## Algorithm

```
1. PeerRoot ← transport:request(Peer, Instance, get_root)
2. if PeerRoot == LocalRoot, done
3. loop:
     Missing ← instance:missing_set(Instance, PeerRoot)
     if Missing is empty, break
     Pages ← transport:request(Peer, Instance, {get_pages, Missing})
     instance:merge_pages(Instance, Pages)
     %% page may reference further pages we still don't have →
     %% next iteration's missing_set picks them up
4. record_sync_complete(Peer, Instance, LocalRoot)
```

The loop is bounded by the depth of the MST plus the number of
divergent pages. With B=16 and a moderate divergence, expect 1–3
iterations.

## API shapes

- `run/3` — synchronous; returns `{ok, FinalRoot}` or `{error, Reason}`.
  Used by tests and consumers that want to await completion.
- `start/3` — asynchronous spawn; the session reports completion via
  `bondy_oplog_peer_state:record_sync_complete/3` and exits.
  Used by the default sync scheduler.

## Bounded iterations

`max_iterations` (default 16) caps the loop to prevent pathological
peers (or buggy transports that always reply with the same incomplete
set) from making the session run forever.

Catalogue-mode bootstrap session. The peer streams its projection
cells in chunks (`get_catalogue_snapshot_init` +
`{get_catalogue_snapshot_next, Cursor}`); the initiator installs each
batch into its own projection. After the stream ends, the lifecycle is
marked `live` (for a fresh caller) and the regular pull-direction sync
runs to catch up on any events newer than the peer's session-start
watermark.

The local instance MUST be catalogue-mode (`crdt_module = undefined`).
Single-CRDT-mode callers must use `bootstrap/3` instead. A
`{error, not_a_catalogue_instance}` is returned otherwise.

If the peer reports `no_snapshot` (it is itself single-CRDT mode, or
has not yet wired a `cell_apply_target`) the call falls through to
plain `run/3`. This handles the new-cluster genesis case cleanly: an
empty peer + empty local replica produces an immediate `done`.

`WasLive` is captured at session start so `finalize_catalogue_bootstrap`
can decide whether to mark live (fresh) or skip the lifecycle update
(recovering).
