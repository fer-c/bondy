Asynchronous writer for one secondary-index shard
(`MST_DB_DESIGN.md` §13). One lightweight gen_server per
`(NS, IndexName, SecShard)` triple, supervised by
`bondy_oplog_secondary_sup`.

## Why a separate process (not a `bondy_oplog_instance`)

The index keyspace has no WAL, no MST, and no signing — it is a pure
deterministic function of the primary, rebuilt from it on cold start
(IDX-4 backfill). A full `bondy_oplog_instance` subtree (`one_for_all`,
co-supervising WAL + MST it would never use) is the wrong shape. The
writer is a mini-applier over the index's ETS projection: it batches the
index ops the primary applier dispatches, read-modify-writes each touched
index cell through the `index_entry` fold, and bumps the shard's
freshness + high-water marks so `{max_lag, Ms}` reads stop refusing.

## Dispatch contract

The primary applier computes the term-diff of every cell it materialises
(old terms vs new terms of the cell's value) and `enqueue/3`s the
resulting index ops to the writer owning each touched secondary shard,
**after** its own projection `put_batch` returns ok. The writer therefore
only ever indexes durably-applied primary state. Ops are
`index_entry`-shaped against an explicit `(SecBucket, SecKey)` cell:

```
{put,    SecBucket, SecKey, Columns :: binary(), Hlc} |
{remove, SecBucket, SecKey, Hlc}
```

`SecKey` is the `(Term, PrimaryKey)` composite from
`bondy_oplog_index_key:encode/2`; `Hlc` is the *primary* cell's HLC, so
the index cell's LWW-over-presence fold converges identically regardless
of whether the op arrived from a local WAL drain or a peer replay.

## Coalescing

Ops buffer and flush on a short timer (`coalesce_ms`, default 5 ms) so a
burst of primary writes to the same secondary shard collapses into one
`put_batch`. `flush_sync/1` forces an immediate flush and is the
deterministic barrier tests (and a future read-side `await_index`) use
to observe a write without polling.

## Handles are re-resolved per flush

The writer caches nothing across flushes: each flush re-`lookup/3`s its
registry row for the projection adapter/handle, cache pair, freshness
atomics, and high-water ref. This keeps it correct across a registry
re-registration (epoch change) for free — and it never owns the ETS
tables it writes (the topology's DB-scoped owner does), so a writer
crash/restart loses only buffered, not-yet-flushed ops, which IDX-4's
rebuild recovers.

## Registry stamp

At init (and on the registry-restart epoch event) the writer stamps its
pid onto its registry row via `set_writer_pid/4` so the primary applier
can find it. The stamp does **not** transfer the registry monitor — the
projection-handle owner keeps it.
