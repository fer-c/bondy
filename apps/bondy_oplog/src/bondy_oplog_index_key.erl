?MODULEDOC("""
Order-preserving composite `(Term, PrimaryKey)` codec for the secondary
index keyspace.

A secondary index is materialised as an **ordered composite keyspace**
queried by range, rather than via leveled's native 2i (which is
incompatible with `head_only` mode). Each index entry is keyed by

```
SecKey = <<TermEnc/binary, 0, PrimaryKey/binary>>
```

so the entries sort first by the normalised, order-preserving term
encoding and then by the raw primary key. Equality reads scan the
contiguous run for one term; range reads scan a `[Lo, Hi)` window.

## Term encoding (`encode_term/1`)

- **Binary terms** are encoded directly (byte order is the comparison
  order callers want).
- **Integer terms** are first mapped to a fixed-width, sign-biased
  big-endian form `<<(N + (1 bsl 63)):64>>` so two's-complement signed
  order becomes unsigned lexicographic order. v1 restricts integer
  terms to the signed 64-bit range; anything outside raises `badarg`.

The byte string is then run through an **order-preserving,
prefix-free, self-delimiting escape** so the encoded term contains no
`0x00` byte:

```
0x00 -> 0x01 0x01
0x01 -> 0x01 0x02
b    -> b            (b >= 0x02)
```

The single `0x00` separator therefore sorts strictly before any encoded
term byte (all `>= 0x01`), which guarantees the primary-key suffix
never corrupts term order even when one term is a byte-prefix of
another. Recovering the primary key is a scan to the first (and only)
`0x00`.

### Deviation from the design's literal byte values

`MST_DB_DESIGN.md §13` sketches the escape as `0x00 -> 0x00 0x01` with a
*bare* `0x00` separator. That scheme is not order-preserving for an
arbitrary appended primary key: when term `T1` is a prefix of term
`T2`, the byte following `T1`'s separator is the primary key's first
byte, which can compare greater than the `0x01` that opens `T2`'s
escaped continuation — inverting the intended `T1 < T2` order. We use a
prefix-free *monotone* code (escape into the `0x01` range, reserve
`0x00` solely as the separator) which is provably order-preserving for
any primary-key suffix. Same goal as the design (order-preserving,
self-delimiting, recover the key by scanning to the separator), correct
construction. See the project convention on preferring empirically
correct implementations over paper-design contracts.

## Bounds

- `equality_bounds(T)` -> `{<<TermEnc(T), 0>>, <<TermEnc(T), 1>>}`, the
  half-open `[Low, High)` window covering exactly term `T`'s entries.
- `range_bounds(Lo, Hi)` -> `{<<TermEnc(Lo), 0>>, <<TermEnc(Hi), 0>>}`,
  the half-open window covering terms in `[Lo, Hi)`.

Both are half-open `[Low, High)` so callers map them onto
`bondy_oplog_core:range/range_all` (exclusive upper bound) without an
off-by-one.
