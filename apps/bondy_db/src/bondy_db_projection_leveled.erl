?MODULEDOC("""
`bondy_oplog_projection_adapter` implementation backed by a leveled
Bookie running in **`head_only` mode** with a SubKey split.

This adapter is a **pure mapper**: it owns no Bookie process, no
supervision, no path layout. It receives an already-opened Bookie pid
via `open/4`'s `Opts` and translates the substrate's seven callbacks
into the corresponding `leveled_bookie` calls.

Bookie lifecycle (start, stop, supervision, path layout, refcounting)
is the caller's concern — the consumer-facing `bondy_db` layer above
the substrate is where those decisions live. The Bookie **must** be
opened with `{head_only, with_lookup}` for this adapter to function;
see `bondy_db_topology_leveled_common:default_book_opts/1` for the
canonical opts.

## SubKey split

Each logical cell `(Bucket, Key)` is stored as **two** leveled HEAD
entries under the `?HEAD_TAG`, distinguished by SubKey:

| SubKey    | Payload (binary)                                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `?SK_STATE` (`<<"s">>`) | `<<HlcLen:16, Hlc/binary, StateBytes/binary>>` |
| `?SK_VALUE` (`<<"v">>`) | `<<HlcLen:16, Hlc/binary, ValueBytes/binary>>` (HEAD wire format) |

Both subkeys carry the HLC so each can be decoded independently.
For folds that declare `value_equals_state/0 -> true` (currently
only G-Set) the value subkey stores a copy of `StateBytes`; the
duplication is a minor space cost in exchange for uniform read
semantics.

## Why head_only mode

Two material wins over the previous `?BONDY_FOLD_TAG` normal-mode
setup:

1. **Atomic batched writes via `book_mput/2`**. The cell-apply engine's
   `bondy_oplog_cell_apply:apply_cell_batch/3` collects all per-event
   writes into a single
   `put_batch/2` call; the adapter then translates that into one
   `book_mput` ObjectSpec list (two specs per cell — `?SK_STATE` +
   `?SK_VALUE`) and ships it to leveled atomically. Previous setup
   required one `book_put` gen_server roundtrip per cell write.
2. **Ledger-only reads**. In `head_only` mode the journal carries
   no body — the entire value is in the LSM HEAD entry. `book_get`
   becomes equivalent to `book_headonly` (no journal hop), so the
   apply path's read of OldState drops from ~1.7 ms (journal seek)
   to <100 µs (ledger lookup). See PR-PS-15a measurement.

## Bucket is call-time

In line with the projection adapter behaviour, every data callback
takes `Bucket` as an argument and forwards it to `leveled_bookie`.
The handle is just the Bookie pid — one handle serves every Bucket
inside the shard.

## Handle shape

```erlang
#{bookie := pid()}
```

## Required `Opts` for `open/4`

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bookie` | `pid()` | The leveled Bookie this `(NS, Index, Shard)` writes to |

Anything else in `Opts` is ignored.

## Range bounds

Leveled's `book_keylist/5` range is **inclusive** on both ends; the
substrate contract is `[Low, High)` (half-open on the high side).
The fold function below excludes any composite key whose underlying
Key matches the High sentinel. Within each Key, only the
`?SK_VALUE` SubKey is enumerated for the range — the state subkey
is fetched on demand to reconstruct the full V2 frame.

## What this adapter does NOT do

- Open, stop, or supervise the Bookie.
- Path management, journal/ledger directory creation, recovery.
- Routing or topology decisions.
- Reuse the legacy `?BONDY_FOLD_TAG` extractor at
  `bondy_db_leveled_tag` — head_only mode bypasses extractors
  entirely (HEAD bytes are written directly via `book_mput`).
