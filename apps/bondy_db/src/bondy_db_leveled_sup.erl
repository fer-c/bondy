?MODULEDOC("""
`simple_one_for_one` supervisor for leveled Bookies under a `bondy_db`
topology.

The supervisor itself is a regular OTP supervisor; topology modules
(`bondy_db_topology_single_bookie`, `bondy_db_topology_per_entity`)
call `start_bookie/2` to provision Bookies and own their lifecycle
inside their own state. The supervisor is started lazily by the
topology's `init/2` rather than wired under `bondy_mst_sup` — the
lifetime of leveled Bookies is bounded by the lifetime of the
topology that owns them.

## Lifecycle

`start_link/0` spawns an unnamed supervisor. The caller (the topology
module's `init/2`) gets the supervisor pid back and stashes it inside
its own state. Topology `shutdown/1` calls `stop/1` here, which exits
the supervisor and brings every child Bookie down with it.

Each Bookie is `temporary` — supervisor restart-after-crash would
deliver a fresh Bookie pid that the topology's existing routing map
does not know about. The topology is responsible for any restart
policy it wants (re-call `start_bookie/2`, refresh its routing map).

Stop the supervisor and every Bookie it owns. Returns `ok` once every
child has terminated.

Children are terminated via `supervisor:terminate_child/2` so leveled's
`terminate/2` runs and flushes the inker. After every child is gone,
the supervisor itself is unlinked and killed — supervisors do not
expose a clean self-stop API and `exit(Sup, shutdown)` is not honoured
by an arbitrary caller.

Provision a leveled Bookie under the supervisor at `Dir` with `Opts`.

`Opts` is the proplist passed straight to `leveled_bookie:book_start/1`.
At minimum it must include the keys leveled requires (typically
`root_path`); see leveled's documentation for the full list. This
module does not validate `Opts` — that is leveled's job.
