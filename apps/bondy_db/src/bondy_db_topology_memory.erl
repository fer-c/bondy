In-memory `bondy_db` topology: one `bondy_oplog_projection_ets` table per
`(EntityType, Shard)`, no leveled Bookie, no filesystem.

```
DB (ephemeral)
├── users
│   ├── ETS(users, 0)
│   ├── ETS(users, 1)
│   └── ...
└── sessions
    └── ETS(sessions, 0)
```

This is the projection backing for **ephemeral** namespaces — state that
must die with the node and reconverge from peers, never be resurrected
from disk (see `bondy_oplog_projection_ets` for the WAMP-registration
rationale). It is the per-namespace "projection backend = ETS" selection:
open the namespace's DB with `topology => bondy_db_topology_memory` and the
whole projection layer is in RAM. Pair it with an in-memory MST store
(`oplog_instance_opts => #{backend => ets}`) and no `storage_path` for a
fully ephemeral stack.

The facade stays topology-agnostic — `route/2` returns the ETS adapter
exactly as the leveled topologies return the leveled adapter, so every
read/write/range path is unchanged.

## Required `topology_opts`

None. `sup` / `dir` (if present, e.g. when reusing a leveled topology's
opts) are accepted and ignored — there is no Bookie to supervise and no
directory to lay out.

## TableState shape

```erlang
#{
    entity_type := atom(),
    shard_count := pos_integer(),
    shards      := #{Shard :: non_neg_integer() := ets:tid()},
    owner       := pid()
}
```

## Ownership

The per-shard ETS tables are **not** owned by the transient process that
calls `bondy_db:open_table/3`. `init/2` starts a dedicated DB-scoped
owner process (`bondy_db_topology_memory_owner`) — the in-RAM analogue of
`bondy_db_leveled_sup` — and every table is created and destroyed inside
it. The owner's lifetime is bracketed by `init/2` → `shutdown/1`,
mirroring the explicit start/stop lifecycle of the appliers that write
the tables; a facade caller dying no longer wipes them (and so no longer
crashes a live applier on a dead tid). `close_table/2` asks the owner to
delete a table's shards on orderly teardown; `shutdown/1` stops the owner,
which deletes every remaining table. See `bondy_db_topology_memory_owner`
for the ownership rationale and the deliberate non-linking.

The same owner also hosts the per-shard **read caches**: this topology
implements the optional `provision_cache/5` + `release_cache/2` hooks so
the facade creates the cache table inside the owner instead of the
caller, and binds the `bondy_oplog_core_registry` monitor to the owner too.
With the projection table, the cache, and the registry row all anchored
in the owner, a write+read driven through the surviving substrate keeps
working after the `open_table/3` caller is gone — full ephemeral
survival, not just the projection.

## Bucket

Bucket is the Realm verbatim. Each `(EntityType, Shard)` has its own table
(EntityType is implicit in the table), so the Bucket only needs to isolate
realms inside it — exactly like `bondy_db_topology_per_entity`.
